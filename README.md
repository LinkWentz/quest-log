# Quest Log - A Productivity App
Quest logs are at this point a standard in modern gaming. Every game that has quests has a place to keep track of them, and every player uses them liberally. 
That being the case means exactly one thing: quest logs are useful. So why not have your own quest log? Instead of just maintaining a to-do list or a journal, 
you can combine them and apply a narrative lens to your day to day. Ok so by this point I must confess the application itself is more trouble than it's worth, 
but it looks cool and works well so it's a well built fidget if nothing else!
