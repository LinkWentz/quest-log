# Quest Log - A Productivity App
This is essentially a to-do app themed after the Cyberpunk 2077 quest log. I wanted a project that was simple, so that I could execute on it really well. Additionally I wanted it to be aligned with my interests, which it may not surprise you to learn mainly consist of video games I like. With all this in mind, I started thinking about how a video game quest log might make a really good to-do app. 

Initially I only took inspiration for the structure of the project from the Cyberpunk 2077 quest log, but I realized it'd be more challenging and therefore fun to replicate the interface instead. I also wanted the project to be simple, which one look at my commit history will tell you has not been the case. However I am really proud of the work I've done so far, so I figured I'd show it off here, even in its incomplete state.
